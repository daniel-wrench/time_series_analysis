- time_series_stats.ipynb: demonstration of key time series statistics on solar wind dataset: ACF, SFn, PSD etc. *Currently only 1D statistics. Check with Mark about getting the best functions for 3D vectors.*
- stochastic_processes.ipynb: simulations of theoretical stochastic processes: white noise, RW, O-U etc.
- arima_forecasting.ipynb: demonstration of workflow for fitting an ARIMA model, including how to check for stationarity
