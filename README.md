# Time Series analysis

## TO-DO
- Add PDF, mean, rms to calc_scales_stats?
- Add ability to select exactly which outputs are calculated?
- Add option to plot fluctuation time series instead of actual values
- Change to not read in separate time series file when plotting?
- Run analysis code on z+ and z- and calculate epsilons too
